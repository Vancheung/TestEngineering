# 【Python3】【LeetCode】【7】Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II 

### 题目

 *Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.*

*Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).*

***Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).*

***Example 1:***

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

***Example 2:***

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

***Example 3:***

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### 实现

#### Version1

valley保存当前的最小值，i遍历数组。

如果valley<i，则加上valley到i的收益，然后让valley=新的i值

如果valley>=i，则valley=新的i值。

实际上，valley就是买入点，持续增长时，买入点与最高点的收益=每日收益累计；

持续下跌时，买入点后移；由亏转盈时，买入点就是当前这个点。

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        if (len(prices) == 0):
            return 0
        result = 0
        valley = prices[0]
        for i in prices[1:]:
            if valley < i:
                result += i - valley
            valley = i
        return result
```

时间复杂度O(n），空间复杂度O(1)，运行时间超过70%的python3答案。最快的答案与这个一致，就不写了。
